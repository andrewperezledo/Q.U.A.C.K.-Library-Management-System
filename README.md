# Q.U.A.C.K.-Library-Management-System
Coming Soon

requirements.txt describes all packages/libraries needed for compilation.
It is recommended packages/libraries are installed in a virtual environment for the purpose of consistency across all development platforms.
To check what is already installed (most desirably inside of virtual environment), enter "pip freeze"
To put these into the requirements.txt file, enter "pip freeze > requirements.txt"

To make things simple, if a package/library is manually installed, edit this README with the command you used, seeing as many are dependencies for a single package installed...

pip install flask  
pip install pymongo  
pip install cryptography
